#Project Description

This was the third homework assignment for my ECON 418, "Intro to Econometrics" class. It is an introduction to machine learning. Using the data provided, 
the objective was to predict if an observations income would be above $50,000. To start Lasso and Ridge regressions where used, and then Random Forests. 
Of the the models investigated the 300 tree random forest proved to be the most accurate with a final classification accuracy of 82.14% on the test data.
